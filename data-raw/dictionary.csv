data,breathablepitlat.rda,site,integer,There are two sites for the field test: site 1 and site 2. A twin-pit pour-flush pit latrine was constructed at each site.
data,breathablepitlat.rda,depth,double,The soil samples were collected at two different depths (1 m and 0.5 m) from ground level.
data,breathablepitlat.rda,lateral,double,"The soil samples were collected from 0.5 m , 1 m,  5 m and 10 m lateral distance away from the pit."
data,breathablepitlat.rda,time,double,This describes the time (in days) of sample collection. The water and soil samples were collected over a period of 322 days.
data,breathablepitlat.rda,test,integer,"The 6 parameters tested from the samples collected in this field test. They include pH,  electrical conductivity,  total coliform,  nitrate, ammonia,  and phosphorus."
data,breathablepitlat.rda,location,integer,"The location of the soil samples marked P1 for unlined and P2 for lined pit. A, B, C, D, E, F are locations around the pits while M is the middle point between the lined and unlined pit."
data,breathablepitlat.rda,values,double,The values measured for said parameter
data,breathablepitlat.rda,num_test,logical,The values measured for said parameter
